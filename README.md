# basic-poker-like-game
This is the final project code for my CSC 120 "Programming on Purpose" class.
The code compares two poker hands, made using a Community Card Set and two sets of Stud cards (like Texas Hold Em). Since this is simplified poker,
the only types of hands that are identified are high card, pair, two pair, and flushes.
